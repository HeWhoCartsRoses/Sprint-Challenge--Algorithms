#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
O(n), due to it running for every n to multiply itself

b)
O(2n)
it runs two loops inside each other
c)
O(1)
## Exercise II
nlog n due to the binary sort method. you drop from the middle of n, then if
it cracks, go to the middle of the next one, so on and so forth.
